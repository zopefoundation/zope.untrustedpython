----------------

- Drop support for Python 2.7, 3.5, 3.6.


5.0 (2022-11-29)
----------------

Backwards incompatible changes
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- Require ``RestrictedPython >= 4``.

- Drop support for writing output of ``print`` calls to a variable named
  ``untrusted_output``. It is now done the same way ``RestrictedPython``
  handles printing, i. e. access it trough the variable ``printed``.
  ``.interpreter.CompiledProgram`` still supports output to a file like object
  by implementing accessing the printed data.

- The following names are no longer available via ``__builtins__`` as they are
  either potentially harmful, not accessible at all or meaningless:

    + ``__debug__``
    + ``__name__``
    + ``__doc__``
    + ``copyright``
    + ``credits``
    + ``license``
    + ``quit``

- Drop support to run the tests using ``python setup.py test``.

- Drop support for Python 2.6.
